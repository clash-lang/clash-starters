# Getting this project
Run `nix-shell --packages stack --run "stack new my-clash-project clash-lang/simple-nix"`.

# Building and testing this project
Build the project with:

```bash
nix-build
```

To test and generate HDL, first open a Nix shell by invoking:

```
nix-shell
```

Then, to run the tests defined in `tests/`:

```bash
cabal run test-library
cabal run doctests
```

To compile the project to VHDL run:

```bash
cabal run clash -- Example.Project --vhdl
```

You can find the HDL files in `vhdl/`. The source can be found in `src/Example/Project.hs`.

# REPL
Clash offers a [REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop) as a quick way to try things, similar to Python's `python` or Ruby's `irb`. Open the REPL by invoking:

```
cabal run clashi
```

# Adding custom dependencies / updating nix
`niv` is available after opening `nix-shell`. See [niv on Hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/niv) for more information.
