# Clash starter projects
This repository houses a number of projects ready to get you going with Clash. You only need [Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/) (recommended) or [GHC](https://www.haskell.org/)+[Cabal](https://www.haskell.org/cabal/) to get going. Stack users can instantiate a project by running:

```
stack new my-clash-project clash-lang/simple
```

where `simple` is one of the projects in this repository. Stack will modify the project such that it is called `my-clash-project`. Cabal users can download one of the `.zip`s in this repository and change the name manually.

Read the `README.md` in each project for more information. Happy hacking!
